### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

* Finder Extension requires manual activation in System Settings

Added features:
- ExtensionManager for detecting and activating Finder Extension
- In-app extension status indicator with direct link to settings
- First-launch prompt to guide users through extension activation
- Self-signing script for better extension compatibility
- Comprehensive installation guide with troubleshooting steps
- FAQ documentation for common issues
- Diagnostic tools for debugging extension problems

Fixed issues:
- Extension not appearing due to unsigned app (documented workaround)
- Version synchronization across all components
- Build workflow now attempts app signing

Documentation:
- Added detailed INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md with step-by-step instructions
- Created FAQ.md addressing common questions and issues
- Updated README with prominent extension activation notice
