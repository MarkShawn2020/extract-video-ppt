# Video2PPT Installation & Setup Guide

## üì• Installation Steps

### 1. Download the Application
- Download the latest `Video2PPT-vX.X.X.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/MarkShawn2020/video2ppt/releases)
- Double-click the DMG file to mount it

### 2. Install the Application
- Drag `Video2PPT.app` to your Applications folder
- Eject the DMG by right-clicking and selecting "Eject"

### 3. First Launch (Important!)
Since Video2PPT is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, you need to:

1. **Right-click** on Video2PPT.app in Applications folder
2. Select **"Open"** from the context menu
3. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog that appears
4. The app will launch and show the main interface

## üîß Enable Right-Click Context Menu

**‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE**: Due to macOS security restrictions, the Finder Extension doesn't work with unsigned apps. We now provide a **Quick Action** alternative that works immediately!

### NEW: Quick Action Method (Works Immediately!)
Since the Finder Extension doesn't work with unsigned apps, use this alternative:

1. **Run the setup script** (included with the app):
   ```bash
   /Applications/Video2PPT.app/Contents/Resources/scripts/install-quick-action.sh
   ```
   Or download and run:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markshawn2020/video2ppt/master/scripts/install-quick-action.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Right-click any video file**
3. Go to **Quick Actions** (or **Services** on older macOS)
4. Select **"Convert to PPT"**

‚úÖ This works immediately without any system settings changes!

### Original Finder Extension Method (Doesn't work with unsigned apps)
Note: This method requires a properly signed app with an Apple Developer certificate.

#### Method 1: From the App
1. Open Video2PPT
2. Look for the extension status indicator at the top of the window
3. If it shows "Extension Disabled", click on it
4. System Settings will open to the Extensions page
5. Enable "Video2PPT Extension"

#### Method 2: From System Settings
1. Open **System Settings** (or System Preferences on older macOS)
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down and click on **Extensions**
4. Select **Finder Extensions** from the sidebar
5. Find **Video2PPT Extension** and check the box

### Verify Extension is Working
1. Right-click on any video file (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)
2. You should see **"Convert to PPT"** in the context menu
3. If not, try:
   - Restarting Finder: Hold Option, right-click Finder in Dock, select "Relaunch"
   - Logging out and back in
   - Restarting your Mac

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Convert to PPT" Not Appearing in Right-Click Menu

#### Issue: Extension Not Enabled
**Solution:**
1. Open Video2PPT app
2. Check the extension status indicator at the top

2. Click "Open" in the security dialog
3. Or go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway"

#### Issue: Quarantine Attribute
**Solution (Terminal):**
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Video2PPT.app
```

   ```bash
   pluginkit -e ignore -i com.video2ppt.Video2PPT.FinderExtension

   ```

3. **Check Console Logs:**
